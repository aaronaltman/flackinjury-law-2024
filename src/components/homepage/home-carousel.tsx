    "â€œI was rear-ended by a vehicle last year while pulling my work trailer. I had personal injury, personal and business property damage. Jonathan Flack and his team continued taking my calls and answering my questions over 6 months until the accident was settled. Because of his guidance, I was able to receive a larger amount of settlement. I can&#39;t say enough about how they always treated me like a person (not a number) and how they went the extra mile to take care of me and my situation. I would use them over and over again. It&#39;s hard to find a team like this that is personable, professional, knowledgeable and honest! Matt S.",
